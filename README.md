#superhappyfunbubbletime

...definitely isn't going to be the name in the long run.
A homebrew adventure game aimed at the old grey Gameboy.
Check out the Wiki hosted here on Github for more info.

*SHFBT is currently not in a workable/playable condition. It is still pre-alpha.*

If there haven't been any updates in a month or two, it's because I've been busy. But SHFBT is always there, in my brain, telling me I have to come back and work on it.

###Building
I use RGBDS. I don't plan on porting it to WLA.

Dependencies are [RGBDS](https://github.com/bentley/rgbds) and make.

To make:

    cd ./superhappyfunbubbletime/
    make

###License
I'm using GPL V2.
