...definitely isn't going to be the name in the long run.
A homebrew adventure game aimed at the old grey Gameboy.

###Building
I use RGBDS. I don't plan on porting it to WLA.
Clone the directory, and then do a normal RGBDS build including all the files.
I may make a makefile... eventually...

###License
I'm using GPL V2.
