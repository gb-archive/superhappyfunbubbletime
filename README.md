#Super Happy Fun Bubble Time

...definitely isn't going to be the name in the long run.
A homebrew adventure game aimed at the old grey Gameboy.
Check out the Wiki hosted here on Github for more info.

*SHFBT is currently not in a workable/playable condition. It is still pre-alpha.*

###Building
I use RGBDS. I don't plan on porting it to WLA.
Clone the directory, and then do a normal RGBDS build including all the files.

Dependencies are RGBDS and make.

To make:
cd ./superhappyfunbubbletime/
make

###License
I'm using GPL V2.
